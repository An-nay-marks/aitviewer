# Parametric Human Models
We support a number of body models from the SMPL family. This means that there are renderables that take as input body model parameters and evaluate the pre-loaded model to visualize the respective sequence. This page explains which models are supported and how to prepare your environment to work with them. It also covers a common use case on how to visualize the outputs of a monocular RGB-based pose estimator. Finally, it explains how new parametric body models can be integrated.
